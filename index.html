	<div id="column1"><h3>Why Flower Euphoria?</h3>
		<p>Flowers brighten our days and fill us with joy and smiles. If we were sent
		flowers every day then our smiles would carry throughout the days and weeks
		to come. Flower Euphoria delivers a different flower everyday to your
		computer, tablet or phone to brighten your day and bring a smile to you. Not
		only will you see a new flower everyday but a little bit of information about
		that flower and any unique details that might pertain to it. </p>
	</div>
	<div id="column2"><h4>Functionality</h4>
		<p>Flower Euphoria provides a flower per day to the user.  The application can sit on the desk top as a small window or minimized
		to the task bar.  When the User wants a cherry disposition to come over them, they can
		maximize the application and view an image of a flower and some interesting details regarding that
		flower being displayed.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="column3"><h5>Upcoming Features</h5>
		<p>As Flower Euphoria grows and comes to evolve, the future concept of the Adobe
		AIR project will be to generate a user input for birthdays and other favorite
		events that they may schedule in a calendar. This will allow the user to view
		flowers for there respective birthday and any day that is of importance to
		them. Along with a custom calendar event, they will be able to link to a florist
		either in their immediate area or any online florist and order flowers for any
		occasion as well through the application.</p>
