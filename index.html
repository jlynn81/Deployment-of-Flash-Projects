					<th>Why Flower Euphoria?</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Flowers brighten our days and fill us with joy and smiles. If we were sent
					flowers every day then our smiles would carry throughout the days and weeks
					to come. Flower Euphoria delivers a different flower everyday to your
					computer, tablet or phone to brighten your day and bring a smile to you. Not
					only will you see a new flower everyday but a little bit of information about
					that flower and any unique details that might pertain to it. </td>
				</tr>	
				<tr>
					<th>Functionality</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Flower Euphoria provides a flower per day to the user.  The application can 
					sit on the desk top as a small window or minimized to the task bar.  When 
					the User wants a cherry disposition to come over them, they can maximize the 
					application and view an image of a flower and some interesting details regarding that
					flower being displayed.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Upcoming Features</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>As Flower Euphoria grows and comes to evolve, the future concept of the Adobe
					AIR project will be to generate a user input for birthdays and other favorite
					events that they may schedule in a calendar. This will allow the user to view
					flowers for there respective birthday and any day that is of importance to
					them. Along with a custom calendar event, they will be able to link to a florist
					either in their immediate area or any online florist and order flowers for any
					occasion as well through the application.</td>
