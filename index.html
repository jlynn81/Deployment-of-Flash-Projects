				<th>Why Flower Euphoria?</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Flowers brighten our days and fill us with joy and smiles. If we were sent
				flowers every day then our smiles would carry throughout the days and weeks
				to come. Flower Euphoria delivers a different flower everyday to your
				computer, tablet or phone to brighten your day and bring a smile to you. Not
				only will you see a new flower everyday but a little bit of information about
				that flower and any unique details that might pertain to it. </td>
			</tr>	
			<tr>
				<th>Functionality</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Flower Euphoria provides a flower per day to the user.  The application can 
				sit on the desk top as a small window or minimized to the task bar.  When 
				the User wants a cherry disposition to come over them, they can maximize the 
				application and view an image of a flower and some interesting details regarding that
				flower being displayed.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Upcoming Features</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>As Flower Euphoria grows and comes to evolve, the future concept of the Adobe
			AIR project will be to generate a user input for birthdays and other favorite
			events that they may schedule in a calendar. This will allow the user to view
			flowers for there respective birthday and any day that is of importance to
			them. Along with a custom calendar event, they will be able to link to a florist
			either in their immediate area or any online florist and order flowers for any
			occasion as well through the application.</td>
